## Devlog

The plan I wrote during class was accurate in some aspects and inaccurate in others. For example, regarding the game objects, I think I was very close to the mark. I created the player, game controller, coins, ground, and a canvas for the UI, which was basically the same as what I included in my plan during class. What I realized I had confused was what the coin prefab's inspector should contain; I forgot that the coin would need a collider and hadn't included it until later.

I created a total of four scripts, which I found funny because I thought I would only need two. Some things I had thought about during class that I would need to use in the game included a loop, and I realized that what was moving wasn't the penguin, but the coins, but I had no idea how to make them move. And yes, right when I was making my game, after a lot of research and understanding, I was able to make my coins move. Another method I had forgotten was important was Destroy(). I didn't know very well how to implement it, and in one attempt I even wrote something wrong, so when my penguin touched the coins, the penguin was the one that disappeared. Fixing this was definitely my favorite part.

I also had difficulty organizing the code in Start(), Update(), or creating a new function, but while I was working on the game, it all came together naturally and logically. It was very fun and stressful.
